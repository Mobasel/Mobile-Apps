# This project aims to analyze two datasets, the first one contains data for the mobile apps from Google Play, and the second one from Apple Store.

- This project was inspired by a project made by [dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/).
- I started it by importing the datasets, then, I cleaned them to remove the duplicates and filtered out the non-English language application, etc...
- Lastly, I analyzed the cleaned datasets to be able to make a data-driven decision.
- The project has been done on Jupyter Notebook using Python_3. 
***
# The two datasets are below:
- [AppleStore.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16324584/AppleStore.csv)

- [googleplaystore.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16324586/googleplaystore.csv)
